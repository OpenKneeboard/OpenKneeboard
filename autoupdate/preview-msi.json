Runtimes are theoretically able to upscale more optimally than OpenKneeboard can. This option should be left off or on automatic unless it is shows a significant improvement on your headset.\r\n- Fixed newly added window capture tabs not starting until reloaded or OpenKneeboard is restarted\r\n- Reduced CPU overhead of DLL injection\r\n- PDFs are now upscaled by default; this improves some fonts that were extremely degraded, but slightly lowers maximum quality\r\n- Fix several crashes on exit\r\n- OpenKneeboard now exits faster\r\n- Fix OpenKneeboard-Viewer crashes when resizing"
