    "body": "# Before installing: this might not be the latest release - [you can always get the latest release here](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/releases/latest)\r\n\r\nStart by downloading [OpenKneeboard-v1.7-alpha5.msi](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/releases/download/v1.7-alpha5/OpenKneeboard-v1.7-alpha5.msi); the documentation is [on OpenKneeboard.com](https://openkneeboard.com).\r\n\r\n## TL;DR\r\n\r\nRewritten app <-> game communication, and all the in-game renderers for improved performance.\r\n\r\n## Long version\r\n\r\n- Sprite the SHM: instead of using 2 2048x2048 textures, a single 4096x2048 texture is used. This allows more efficient operations\r\n- Refactored all the renderers to be have a consistent feel and increase code sharing between nonvr/openxr/oculus\r\n- D3D11 renderer: single draw call for both kneeboards\r\n- D3D12 renderer: single draw call for both kneeboards, no D3D11on12, much less blocking. Supports multiple concurrent frames.\r\n- Vulkan renderer: ... complete rewrite. From-scratch SpriteBatch implementation. No longer uses D3D11, pure Vulkan, much less blocking. Supports multiple concurrent frames.\r\n- Viewer: rewritten to support any of the renderers. Specify with `-G D3D11`, `-G D3D12`, `-G Vulkan`. Default is still D3D11\r\n- Viewer: use D3D11 for background; Direct2D is still used for text\r\n- Viewer: automatically disable Direct2D if RenderDoc is attached\r\n- Viewer: press 'F' to cycle background 'F'ill options. 'B' was already used for borderless.\r\n- Viewer: added checkerboard background options\r\n- added statically-and-dynamically enforced StateMachine abstraction\r\n- use StateMachine in various places, including checking the new SHM approach is being handled correctly\r\n- add missing client-side fences\r\n- add tracelogging wrappers\r\n- added `OPENKNEEBOARD_LOG_AND_FATAL()` option; use it heavily. This gets much more meaningful dumps for multithreaded programs."
