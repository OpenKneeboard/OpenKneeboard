    "body": "Start by downloading [OpenKneeboard-v1.9.2.msi](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/releases/download/v1.9.2/OpenKneeboard-v1.9.2.msi); the documentation is [on OpenKneeboard.com](https://openkneeboard.com).\r\n\r\n# Warning\r\n\r\nThis version of OpenKneeboard has not been thoroughly tested; you are more likely to encounter issues. **It is intended for developers and testers**.\r\n\r\nIt is *highly* recommended that you back up your `Saved Games\\OpenKneeboard` folder before using this version.\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n\r\n- Web pages can now choose to support multiple pages, drawing-on-top, or custom cursor handling; see [developer documentation](https://openkneeboard.com/api/web-dashboards.html)\r\n- Web pages can now open the developer tools window from JavaScript\r\n- Added support for [plugins](https://openkneeboard.com/api/web-dashboards/plugins.html), which allow third-party tools to define custom tab types or support custom actions\r\n- Added 32-bit OpenXR support\r\n- Re-introduced support for webp. OpenKneeboard will now detect when Microsoft's WebP support violates standard behavior, and avoid doing anything else until it has finished and standard behavior resumes; this is usually < 1 ms.\r\n- TypeScript files are now included for the JS APIs\r\n- Single file and folder tabs now support HTML files\r\n\r\n# Backwards-Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n- OpenKneeboard no longer adds the `OpenKneeboard` and `OpenKneeboard_WebView2` CSS classes to Web Dashboard `<body>` tags, to avoid compatibility issues with frameworks that require complete ownership of the DOM. \r\n- Settings are now stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\OpenKneeboard\\Settings` instead of `Saved Games\\OpenKneeboard`\r\n\r\n# Other Major Changes\r\n\r\n- Rewritten SimHub integration should be more flexible, and less likely to break with future SimHub updates\r\n- Updated to Windows App SDK v1.6; this fixes several mouse emulation issues with Web Dashboards, including drop-downs and several issues related to dragging\r\n- Internal changes that aim to replace '*might* crash or do something weird *later*' with '*will* crash *now*'; in the short-term, this may increase the frequency of crashes, but it will make it much easier to diagnose and fix crashes that are reported in the ftuure\r\n  - Developers: this is largely replacing winrt coroutines with a new `OpenKneeboard::task<>` custom promise/awaitable. In many cases, this also turns silent corruption into compile errors, which have been resolved.\r\n  - Developers: this also increases usage of `OpenKneeboard::StateMachine<>`, adding both compile-time and runtime checks for transitions and expected stat compile-time and runtime checks for transitions and expected stat compile-time and runtime checks for transitions and expected states\r\n- Improved error handling in PDF loading\r\n- Fixed crashes when switching profiles while the previous profile is still loading\r\n- Custom crash handler now includes more information in minidumps, and creates a small, more easily-shareable crash .txt file\r\n\r\n# Smaller Changes\r\n\r\n- Improved D3D11 compatibility by replacing custom saved states with `ID3DDevicecontextState` from D3D11.1\r\n- `OculusSDK_DiscardDepthInformation` is no longer enabled by default; Oculus SDK is no longer recommended for DCS World in any circumstances, and the option is not needed for other games\r\n- OpenXR API Layer: version number now encodes the OpenKneeboard version, instead of always being 1 `(MAJOR << 24) | MINOR`\r\n- OpenXR API layer: improved conformance of `xrEnumerateApiLayerProperties` and `xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties`\r\n- Fixed rare crash on shutdown\r\n- Settings are now automatically backed up after upgrade/downgrade\r\n- 'Always update swapchain' option has been removed, and is now always on. This commonly triggered bugs in other OpenXR components, and while it marginally improved performance, it reduced the predictability of frame times and increased the amount of testing required\r\n\r\n# Internal-Only Changes\r\n\r\n- Moved from C++20 to C++23\r\n- Renamed `scope_guard` to `scope_exit`,  adding `scope_success` and `scope_failure`, for consistency with C++ library fundmantals TS v3\r\n- coroutines everywhere. Tabs and page sources are now loaded/refreshed/drawn with coroutines\r\n- Added a 'Developer Tools' page to settings; this is shown in untagged builds, but can also be enabled by setting `AlwaysShowDeveloperTools` to `true` in `App.json`\r\n- Renamed `GameEvent` to `APIEvent`\r\n- Replaced `weak_refs` with [bindline](https://github.com/fredemmott/bindline); this added compile-time detection of several bugs, which have been resolved\r\n- Added `OPENKNEEBOARD_TraceLoggingCoro` which allows out-of-order start/stop events\r\n- Added `symbolize-log.exe` to symbols zip for making readable stack traces from crash log files\r\n- `OpenKneeboard::task<>` will directly call `fatal()` on uncaught exceptions, or if it is not awaited\r\n- Stop setting `XR_COMPOSITION_LAYER_CORRECT_CHROMATIC_ABBERATION_BIT` on OpenXR Quad Layers, as it is deprecated in OpenXR 1.1, and has never done anything in any OpenXR runtime\r\n\r\n"
