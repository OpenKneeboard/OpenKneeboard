This will slightly improve performance, and stop OpenKneeboard from being shown twice when SteamVR is being used via OpenXR\r\n- The font size for plain text pages can now be changed in advanced settings - thanks to @bbirchnz\r\n- Improved compatibility when using OpenXR and D3D12 on a Varjo headset\r\n- Improved compatibility with the HTC Vive OpenXR runtime; this does not affect the older Vive headsets that run via SteamVR\r\n- Improved compatibility with D3D11, especially non-VR or when using OpenComposite.\r\n- Improved render quality of fixed-size images\r\n- Improved non-VR text render quality\r\n- Improved handling of hotplugged input devices\r\n- Improved handling of invalid/corrupted JSON settings files\r\n- Debug log now includes when the various renderers were last active\r\n- Debug log now includes UAC settings\r\n- OpenKneeboard's window will no longer open in the same position it was when closed if that position is not visible on any currently connected/active monitor.\r\n- It is now possible to correct the paths used for new DCS aircraft when OpenKneeboard is not yet aware of them; see https://openkneeboard.com/troubleshooting/dcs-tabs.html#the-path-is-incorrect-for-some-aircraft",
