    "body": "# Before installing: this might not be the latest release - [you can always get the latest release here](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/releases/latest)\r\n\r\nStart by downloading [OpenKneeboard-v1.6.1.msi](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/releases/download/v1.6.1/OpenKneeboard-v1.6.1.msi); the documentation is [on OpenKneeboard.com](https://openkneeboard.com).\r\n\r\nThis release (v1.6.1):\r\n- fixes an issue introduced in v1.6.0 where content could appear out of place and undersized on high-DPI screens (e.g. 4k); this only affected the OpenKneeboard app window, not in-game.\r\n- can increase the visual quality of content in the app window on high-DPI screens compared to v1.5 and below; the effect depends on the specific content being shown.\r\n\r\nThe previous release (v1.6.0):\r\n- fixes a bug leading to poor performance of the OpenKneeboard app when it is the active window and a window capture is in progress\r\n- adds support for cropping captured windows to the 'client area'; this is the area excluding the classic Windows title bar, menu bar, and window frame. This feature will not work with apps with a non-standard title bar.\r\n- added an option to capture the Windows mouse cursor; as OpenKneeboard's tablet input does not move the Windows mouse cursor, tablet input will not result in a visible or captured Windows mouse cursor.\r\n- updates to the latest version of the Windows App SDK"
