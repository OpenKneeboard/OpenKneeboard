    "body": "# Before installing: this might not be the latest release - [you can always get the latest release here](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/releases/latest)\r\n\r\nStart by downloading [OpenKneeboard-v1.7-alpha7.msi](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/releases/download/v1.7-alpha7/OpenKneeboard-v1.7-alpha7.msi); the documentation is [on OpenKneeboard.com](https://openkneeboard.com).\r\n\r\n- Removed 'dual kneeboards' option from advanced settings; add a second 'view' from the VR settings page instead.\r\n- VR views can now be positioned independently, or as mirroring another\r\n- Support for up to 16 VR views. Actual limit varies depending on your headset, runtime, and the game.\r\n- Moved most VR settings to per-view; while header/footer/bookmarks can only be individually controlled for the app as a whole, each view has a 'all on/all off' option\r\n- Added 'default tab' per-view option\r\n- Fixed intermittent game crashes when restarting the app, showing/hiding, or switching tabs.\r\n- Improved performance of show/hide\r\n- Improved performance of navigation tab\r\n- Improved performance when multiple views are showing the same file (not necessarily the same page)\r\n- Improved PDF hyperlink and table-of-contents compatibility for PDFs produced with Adobe FrameMaker or LaTeX\r\n\r\nIf you're not using this as a kneeboard, you probably want to use the 'default tab' option to set up each view."
