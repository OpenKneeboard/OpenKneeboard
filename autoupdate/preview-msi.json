Issues were more likely and more pronounced with large numbers of window captures/web dashboards\r\n- Improve performance and fix stutters/stalls when web dashboards or captured windows are resized\r\n- Fix crash if non-VR support is enabled and the game changes resolution\r\n- Fix crash if switching profile or OpenKneeboard is closed while a window capture or web dashboard frame is in progress\r\n\r\n# Changes in v1.7.3-rc1\r\n\r\n- Frame rate and timing for OpenKneeboard, the app window, the game, and any other viewers are now independent. This should fix stutters when not running OpenKneeboard on high-refresh-rate VRR monitors, or when the game frame loop pauses\r\n- If games or viewers stall, crash, or otherwise exit improperly, this should no longer freeze or crash OpenKneeboard\r\n- SteamVR overlays will no longer lag by 1 OpenKneeboard frame; this would previously appear as showing as multiple tabs being visible overlapped, or, just not updating at all, especially when the footer clock is disabled\r\n- Improved performance and removed stutters when resizing or moving the app window"
