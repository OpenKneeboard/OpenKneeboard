Previous versions would only copy the 'dual kneeboards' setting from v1.6 and below, which was replaced with the 'views' feature\r\n- Fix crash when changing tab settings, switching profile, then changing settings for the same kind of tab (workaround for WinUI3 UI caching bug)\r\n- Updated to Windows App SDK v1.5.2; this fixes:\r\n  - timers - including the frame timer - triggering incorrectly if the primary display is not running at 60hz\r\n  - several issues with autosuggest and drop-down popups when display scaling is not set to 100%\r\n  - several crashes when interacting with the OpenKneeboard app\r\n\r\n# Other changes\r\n\r\n- When adding a new Window Capture tab for an iOverlay window, OpenKneeboard will default to matching the window title\r\n- Changed description of 'games' settings to clarify when games need to be added\r\n"
