    "body": "# Before installing: this might not be the latest release - [you can always get the latest release here](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/releases/latest)\r\n\r\nStart by downloading [OpenKneeboard-v1.4.4.msi](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/releases/download/v1.4.4/OpenKneeboard-v1.4.4.msi); the documentation is [on OpenKneeboard.com](https://openkneeboard.com).\r\n\r\nThis release:\r\n- fixes enabling/disabling double-buffering for Varjo+OpenXR+D3D12 under Settings -> Advanced -> Quirks. Previously the option in the UI did not actually change the setting.\r\n- fixes capturing of windows when they are un-minimized\r\n- fixes tabs not updating at the expected framerate if the tab list has been changed or reordered; this was especially noticeable for window capture tabs\r\n- adds an option in tab settings to not require that the window 'class' (type) matches; this option can remove the need to remove and re-add the capture tab every time the captured window is shown/hidden or the captured app is restarted\r\n- switch default to matching window title and not matching window class when capturing WPF windows, such as SimHub\r\n\r\nThe window 'class' is meant to identify the type of window - for example, 'MyApp Main Window', 'MyApp Overlay', 'MyApp About Dialog'. By default, OpenKneeboard looks for windows of the same class/type that was originally captured.\r\n\r\nSome frameworks - including Microsoft's WPF - generate unique class names every time a window is shown, so the class can't be used to match windows across app restarts.",
