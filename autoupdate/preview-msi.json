Bookmarks are visible in all tabs, and take you back to the specific page. For v1.4, bookmarks last until OpenKneeboard is restarted.\r\n  - added remote controls and bindings for next/previous/toggle bookmarks\r\n- Added brightness control/tint\r\n  - tint and brightness can be controlled in advanced settings\r\n  - added toggle on/off and increase/decrease brightness bindings and remote controls\r\n  - added disable and enable tint remote controls\r\n- OpenKneeboard-Viewer now supports borderless mode by pressing 'b'\r\n- Added support for binding mice scroll wheels (vertical only)\r\n- Basic remote controls now optionally take a parameter for number of repetitions - for example, `...NEXT_PAGE.exe 5` will move forward 5 pages\r\n- Experimental: added support for Vulkan OpenXR games\r\n- Experimental: added a [Lua API](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/blob/master/docs/api/lua.md); this allows you to, for example:\r\n  - switch profiles depending on aircraft, terrain, or time of day\r\n  - control brightness with in-cockpit controls\r\n- Experimental: added an equivalent [C API](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/blob/master/docs/api/c.md), which is also [usable from Python](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/blob/master/docs/api/python.md)\r\n\r\n# Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- \"Autodetect\" will no longer render a non-VR kneeboard in the game window when OpenKneeboard's OpenXR support is active in the game\r\n- Navigation will now be auto-generated for PDFs that do not include an index, with one navigation entry per page\r\n\r\n# UI improvements\r\n\r\n- \"Add Game\", \"Add Tab\", and \"Add  Profile\" buttons now appear at both the top and bottom of the relevant pages\r\n- It is now possible to rename tabs (or bookmarks) by right clicking on them\r\n\r\n# Other changes\r\n\r\n- Added a registry setting to write logs to `Saved Games\\OpenKneeboard\\logs`\r\n- Improved overall performance\r\n- Added an option in advanced setting to show OpenKneeboard's frame count in game; this is how many times OpenKneeboard's updated, not the number of game frames"
