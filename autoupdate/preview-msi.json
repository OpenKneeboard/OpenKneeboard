This is fixed for D3D11 and Vulkan, but not yet fixed for D3D12. As a workaround, you can turn off the header and footer for all views in advanced settings instead - [#658](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard/issues/658)\r\n- ‚ú® OpenKneeboard-Viewer: support unscaled rendering - press 'U' to activate\r\n- ü©π OpenXR conformance: return `XR_ERROR_LIMIT_REACHED` instead of `XR_ERROR_RUNTIME_FAILURE` if an `XrSession` is created while another is still active\r\n- ü©π OpenXR conformance: return `XR_ERROR_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED` for Vulkan functions if the application has not enabled the relevant extensions\r\n- üë∑ Improvements to crash logging and dumps\r\n- üêõ Fix crash if a coroutine throws an exception that should be caught\r\n- üêõ Fix crash if a timer is cancelled after it is created but before it is started\r\n- üêõ Fix crash if Windows returns an error when checking if the DCS saved games folder exists\r\n- üîä Include Windows version and edition (e.g. Home, Pro, Enterprise) in debug logs\r\n- ‚ö°Stopped switching back to original thread for coroutines with discarded results (`fire_and_forget`)\r\n- üêõ Remove assertion if a coroutine is returned on the same thread/COM context, but the thread ID has changed (e.g. for tasks on the windwos thread bool)\r\n- üßë‚Äçüíª Added debug names to various D3D12 resources\r\n- üöß Started replacing WinUI3 with WebView-based UI; 'Developer Tools' settings page is no longer using WinUI\r\n\r\nThe OpenXR+D3D12 changes primarily improve compatibility with MSFS 2024.\r\n\r\nSome bugfixes have not been applied to v1.8 as:\r\n- the bugs are unlikely to cause practical problems for most people\r\n- the fixes depend on invasive changes that carry the risk of reducing overall stability, so for now, are only suitable for test versions\r\n"
