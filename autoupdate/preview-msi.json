This feature will not work with apps with a non-standard title bar.\r\n- added an option to capture the Windows mouse cursor; as OpenKneeboard's tablet input does not move the Windows mouse cursor, tablet input will not result in a visible or captured Windows mouse cursor.\r\n- updates to the latest version of the Windows App SDK"
