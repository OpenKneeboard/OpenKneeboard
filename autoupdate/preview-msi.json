    "body": "- ⚡ VRAM that OpenKneeboard shares with the game now takes top priority when more VRAM is needed than available; as this VRAM is always needed within 3 frames, this may make things *less* bad if your system runs out of VRAM. This only affects the VRAM used to store the final rendered kneeboards\r\n- 🩹 If the F16 key is bound, the label is now shown instead of the hex key code. F1-15 and F17-24 were already handled\r\n- 🩹 The admin/UAC checks are now skipped if Wine is detected, as Wine always reports that things are running as admin. OpenKneeboard is not expected to work under Wine, however, I did not intend to put a hard block on it.\r\n- 🔊 Added VRAM usage to debug logs zip\r\n- 🔊 Added more detailed logging if an OpenXR application uses an unsupported graphics API (e.g. OpenGL)"
