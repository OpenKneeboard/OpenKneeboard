This fix was previously limited to D3D11 and Vulkan\r\n- üêõ Fixed \"Metadata file 'v1.json' has an unknown size\" error when installing plugins on some systems\r\n- üêõ Fixed drawing on endless notebook tabs\r\n- üêõ Fixed crash when entering syntactically invalid URLs, e.g. URLs with spaces in the hostname\r\n- üêõ Fixed crash when turning off OpenTabletDriver\r\n- üêõ Fixed various crashes caused by [Microsoft C++ library bugs](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/10692305)\r\n- üêõ Fixed hangs if timer awaitables are cancelled before they are started\r\n- ü©π The \"OpenTabletDriver is misconfigured\" message is now only shown if you explicitly turned OTD on or if you have previously used it\r\n- ü©π The \"You are running as administrator\" messages no longer depend on the application UI loading correctly, and are also shown for unsupported UAC configurations\r\n- üî•Removed 'run as normal user' option; Windows updates made it so the option no longer worked correctly\r\n- üî•Removed `RawCursorEvents` JavaScript experimental feature; it should not be needed any more due to the move from WebView2 to CEF\r\n- üî•Legacy Oculus + D3D12 support has been removed; I'm not aware of any games that were using this combination"
