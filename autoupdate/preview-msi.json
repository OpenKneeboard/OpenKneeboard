This should fix stutters when not running OpenKneeboard on high-refresh-rate VRR monitors, or when the game frame loop pauses\r\n- If games or viewers stall, crash, or otherwise exit improperly, this should no longer freeze or crash OpenKneeboard\r\n- SteamVR overlays will no longer lag by 1 OpenKneeboard frame; this would previously appear as showing as multiple tabs being visible overlapped, or, just not updating at all, especially when the footer clock is disabled\r\n- Improved performance and removed stutters when resizing or moving the app window"
