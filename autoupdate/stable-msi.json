If you are using remote controls or the API to switch profiles, this may change which profile is switched to.\r\n\r\nEditing OpenKneeboard's settings file except via the OpenKneeboard app remains unsupported, and may lead to OpenKneeboard crashing or other problems. As editing the settings files outside of OpenKneeboard is not supported, any issues encountered are not considered bugs; I've added support for this particularly common incorrect edit as a one-off exception."
