# Graphics Tablets

Graphics tablets (eg Wacom) are supported, *but not required*. These are generally marketed towards artists and
designers.

**Phones and tablet computers such as an iPad, Microsoft Surface, or similar are a different kind of device and not
supported**.

Graphics tablets can be used to:

- interact with the in-game toolbar: switch pages, tabs, profiles, toggle bookmarks and so on
- sketch or take notes
- click on links in PDF documents
- navigate the table of contents in PDF documents
- interact with [captured windows](./window-capture.md)

## Which tablet to get

- The Wacom Intuos S is my first recommendation
  - it is a good size, with buttons that are easy to find in VR
  - while OpenTabletDriver is *strongly* recommended and Wacom's own recent drivers are limited, v6.4.5 of the Wacom driver (Jan 2024) is the best non-OpenTabletDriver option available for OpenKneeboard
- The Gaomon S620 is a similar size, also with easily-findable buttons, and is cheaper
  - Pen strokes don't register for a fraction of a second after pressing a pen button; this can require a slight pause when erasing, but is often not noticeable
  - OpenTabletDriver is required for a good experience
- The Huion H640P is also a popular choice, and also more affordable than Wacom
  - I find the buttons harder to find blind in VR
  - OpenTabletDriver mandatory for a good experience
- Alternatively, [any tablet supported by OpenTabletDriver](https://opentabletdriver.net/Tablets) can be used, though I suggest sticking with one of the ones above

These recommendations are for the best experience in OpenKneeboard; it's probably not good advice for other uses, such as graphics software or *osu!*.
