## Getting Help

First, [check the troubleshooting guides](../troubleshooting/).

I make this for my own use, and I share this in the hope others find it useful; I'm not able to commit to support, bug fixes, or feature development.

I am not able to respond to 1:1 requests for help via any means, including GitHub, Discord, Twitter, Reddit, or email.

You may be able to get help in #openkneeboard-help [on Discord](https://go.openkneeboard.com/discord).
